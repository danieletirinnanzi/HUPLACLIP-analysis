This time you will complete two experiments. They are the very similar to the one you performed last time, only the stimuli will be represented differently on the screen, as you will read in the tutorial.
If you can, raise the volume of your device: the experiment includes audio feedback.
You can do the experiments in the order that you prefer, and remember that there is no time limit for completing them.

SECOND LINK (in this experiment, it might take a while to present the following stimulus once you respond: please be patient):


In case you encountered any problems or you think you are not seeing the stimuli properly, don't hesitate to tell me!
Thank you for your time!!
