- Add more accepted vertical resolutions (1050,1152,1200,1344,1392,1400,1800,1824,1964) -> change to >1024? Check if resize of canvas works also when zoom is not 100%;
- N1000 -> slow generation of stimuli induces errors (Nawal);
- Anna and Nawal -> blurry instruction and task familiarization images (device specs: Anna (1960x1080), Nawal (1960x1080) ). Possibility of doing these phases already with the canvas, so that it adapts to the screen;
- Ben:
* had the feeling like the task was easier when the side of the graph with the clique was changing;
* strategy of not looking at the stimulus directly, he was intentionally seeing it blurry so that the regularities were more evident.
- Marlen:
* perceived the N1000 task as way easier than the N300 one
* conspiracists tend to better find visual associations (literature)
- add new experiment structure image and uncomment in experiment scripts




----------

- data saving:
* remove "graphs_couple" (right now it outputs an empty variable)
* too many quotes in the files -> check how they are saved (use single quotes??)
- CSV FORMATTING PROBLEM (issue for scalability of experiment) -> ask Lollo Nesi and Ben if they were using a specific browser -> csv file formatting issues
